The CityBuilder Engine is a fantastic game development framework crafted for creating engaging city-building simulations. It harnesses the incredible power of Unreal Engine 5, bringing stunning graphics to life with techniques like ray tracing and Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). I’m really looking forward to adding these features to enhance the visuals, even though I’m not quite sure how to do it just yet! The engine is modular, making it easy for developers to expand functionality through clear components for managing resources, buildings, population, events, and user interfaces. With a focus on performance and scalability, CityBuilder is ready to tackle complex game mechanics and create vibrant urban life simulations. It’s going to be an exciting journey!
